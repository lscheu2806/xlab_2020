This is a Rstudio project directory with the subject of analyzing the 
data collected throughout the online experiment. The 'renv' package 
(https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) was utilized to ensure that group 
would use the same environment while working on the analyses, and can be 
used by anyone to reproduce the packages that the group worked with 
to attain the exact conditions under which the analyses were performed.

The two directories '01_pilot' and '02_main' contain the R code used to 
preprocess, visualize, and analyze the data collected in the pilot study 
and the main study respectively. The R scripts are the same, save for 
minor adjustments to filepaths and a change to the preprocessing script 
to remove an outlier in the main study's data set.

# Analyses
## Pilot
The folder consists of the data and the plots for the pilot of our experiment.

## Main
The folder consists of the data, tables containing the results of the analysis and the plots of the main experiment.

### Confirmatory plots
In the following figures we plotted the correspond of the sentence frames *each* and *together* and predicates as well as the sentence frame *bare* and the predicates.

### Exploratory plots
The following plots show the reaction times for the different predicates, scenarios and sentence frames of the main experiment.
