At first I didn't notice that there were only two blue boxes - the lines could have been thicker.
Some choices I did not think matched any (Ie each box was tall)\n\nI chose the heavy attribute to the ones stacked more carefully and well-aligned as I inferred heavy things should be managed more carefully.\n\nVery cool study! Post it to reddit when you’re done :)!

Using "together" in those sentences does not sound like something a native English-speaker would typically say.\n\nI figure you're trying to see if "each" and "together" imply dual, or a plural greater than two - and I think you might find interesting results if you compare "each" and "all".

How am I meant to tell the weight
