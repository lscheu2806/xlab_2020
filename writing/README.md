# Writing 
This directory contains the replication study's preregistration report
and a document outlining its experimental design. Their
drafts were sent in for preliminary feeback on the 15th of July, 2020. The
feedback was received on the 21st of July, 2020. The final drafts were
submitted for evaluation alongside a link to the online experiment on
the 28th of July, 2020. The state of the two reflects their state at the
point of submission.

The final report was written after the conclusion of the main experiment
and submitted for evaluation as part of this repository on the 1. August 2020.
