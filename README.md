# Replication study "validating the paraphrase methodology" by Scontras and Goodman
## The study
Our replication study is meant to validate the findings of the experiment "Resolving uncertainty in plural predication" by Gregory Scontras and Noah D. Goodman. To approve our experiment and check if the implementation and analysis works in the expected way, we started a pilot study with 3-5 participants. The data collection for the pilot was possible from Thursday, Jul 23 2020 10pm GMT+02:00 until Friday, Jul 24 2020 2.30pm. 4 people participated.  
The main study started on Friday, Jul 24 2020 6pm and ended on Monday, Jul 27 2020 6pm. 149 people participated.

## The folder structure
This repository consists of all important documents, implementations, figures and pictures which are included in our replication.

### Analyses
We collected our analyses of the pilot and main study in here. You will find the implementations in R as well as the figures and tables with the analysis of the collected data.

### Data
The raw and cleaned data is located in the data folder. The raw data includes all data we collected. The clean data was obtained from the raw data by wrangling it using the scripts found in *analyses*. The important variables are *submission_id*,*trial_number*,*scenario*,*predicate*,*sentence_frame*,*RT* and *response*.

### Experiments
This folder contains the magpie implementations for the experiments conducted for the pilot and the main study.

### Literature
Background as well as the original paper(s) can be found in here.

### Writing
This folder includes:
* The experimental design
* The preregistration report
